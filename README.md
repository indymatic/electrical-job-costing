# Electrical Job Costing Software

This project is a web-based application designed to help electricians estimate job costs by calculating the price of electrical materials (e.g., wires, conduits, outlets) based on box store pricing or custom rates. It includes a login page and a job creation portal.

## Features
- **Login Page**: A simple login interface (frontend only; backend not implemented).
- **Job Creation Portal**: Allows users to create jobs, select electrical items, adjust quantities, and calculate total costs.
- **Pricing Data**: Uses mock pricing data for common electrical materials.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository: 
2. Install `http-server` (requires Node.js):
3. Run the app:
4. Open `http://localhost:8081` in your browser to view the app.

## Future Improvements
- Add a backend for user authentication and job storage.
- Fetch real-time pricing data from box stores (e.g., Home Depot, Loweâ€™s).
- Improve the UI/UX with better styling and responsiveness.

## Technologies Used
- HTML, JavaScript (React via CDN)
- Tailwind CSS (via CDN)
